# Welcome to the Compsac13extension wiki!

# Our experimental environmentï¼š
* Ubuntu12.04.4
* Javalanche-0.4
* JDK1.8.0_20
* Ant1.8.2

# The projects we used:
* barbecue_1.5_alpha
* jgrapht_0.5.0
* jgraph_0.5.1
* joda-time_0.98
* joda-time_1.0
* joda-time_2.1
* timeandmoney_0.2
* timeandmoney_0.3
* timeandmoney_1.4
* xml-security_1.2.0
* xml-security_1.2.1
* xml_security_1.3.0

We have commented out some testMethods in org.apache.xml.security.test.encryption.BaltimoreEncTest and org.apache.xml.security.test.encryption.XMLCipherTester in the three xml-serucity versions because these failed testMethods can stop javalanche from normal running.
